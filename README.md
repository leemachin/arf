# Arf

**STATUS: experimental**

Give developers the praise they deserve (or unwanted attention they
probably don't) by showing when they break *or fix* a build. For funsies.

## Usage

None, unless you're doing it for shits and giggles.

TODO: Explain extremely specific requirements, such as the need for a
certain brand of LED Board, a Raspberry Pi, a Travis Pro account,
etc. etc. etc.

Having got those things, I would hope this works with a simple command
in the terminal:

```shell
TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN=... arf --daemonize
```

## Credit where credit's due

@olivernn - for doing all the hard work with the LED Board and
convenient gem to send things to it.
